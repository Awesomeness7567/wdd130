        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Twelve-year-old Sophie Foster has a secret. She is a Telepath—someone who hears the thoughts of everyone around her by her own control. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s a talent she’s never known how to explain to anyone.
            But everything changes the day she meets Fitz, a mysterious boy who appears out of nowhere. 
            <br>
            <br>
            She discovers there’s a place she does belong, and that staying with her family will place her in grave danger. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In the blink of an eye, Sophie is forced to leave behind everything and start a new life in a new world that is vastly different from her own.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sophie has new rules to learn and new skills to master, and not everyone is thrilled about her “homecoming.” There are secrets buried deep in Sophie’s memory—secrets people desperately want.
            <br>
            <br>
            Secrets they might even kill for...

        <h4>Excerpt</h4>
        <p>Blurry, fractured images swam through Sophie's mind, but she couldn't piece them together. She tried opening her eyes and found only darkness. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Something rough pressed against her wrists and ankles, refusing to let her move.
            A wave of cold rushed through her as the horrifying realization dawned.
            <br>
            <br>
            She was a hostage.
            <br>
            <br>
            A cloth across her lips stifled her cry for help, and a sedative's sweet aroma stung her nose when she inhaled, making her head spin.
            <br>
            <br>
            Were they going to kill her?
            <br>
            <br>
            Would the Black Swan really destroy their own creation?
            What was the point of Project Moonlark, then? What was the point of the Everblaze?
            <br>
            <br>
            The drug lulled her toward a dreamless oblivion, but she fought back - clinging to the one memory that could shine a tiny spot of light in the thick, inky haze. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A pair of beautiful aquamarine eyes.
            Fitz's eyes. The first friend in her new life. Her first friend ever.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe if she hadn't noticed him that day in the museum, none of this would have happened.
            <br>
            <br>
            No. She knew it'd be too late even then. The white fires were already burning - curving toward her city and filling the sky with sticky, sweet smoke.
            <br>
            <br>
            The spark before the blaze.
