        <p>
            Secret identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone…except the villains they once overthrew. Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova’s allegiance is to a villain who has the power to end them both.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ever since the day her family was murdered, Nova has been unable to sleep. But she doesn’t miss it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In fact, her insomnia is part of her superpower: She never sleeps, and can put others to sleep just by touching them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After her family was taken from her, Nova was raised by the Anarchists, a group of villains who live hidden beneath the city, lying in wait to take down the Renegades and reclaim Gatlon for themselves. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But now Nova is old enough to participate in the Renegade trials and potentially infiltrate their ranks. If she makes it through the trials, the Anarchists may come out of hiding.
