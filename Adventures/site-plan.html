      <h3>[KOTLC]</h3>
      <p>
        Twelve-year-old Sophie Foster has a secret. She is a Telepath—someone who hears the thoughts of everyone around her by her own control. It’s a talent she’s never known how to explain to anyone.

        But everything changes the day she meets Fitz, a mysterious boy who appears out of nowhere. She discovers there’s a place she does belong, and that staying with her family will place her in grave danger. In the blink of an eye, Sophie is forced to leave behind everything and start a new life in a new world that is vastly different from her own.
        
        Sophie has new rules to learn and new skills to master, and not everyone is thrilled about her “homecoming.” There are secrets buried deep in Sophie’s memory—secrets people desperately want.
        
        Secrets they might even kill for...

        Preface: Blurry, fractured images swam through Sophie's mind, but she couldn't piece them together. She tried opening her eyes and found only darkness. Something rough pressed against her wrists and ankles, refusing to let her move.

        A wave of cold rushed through her as the horrifying realization dawned.
        
        She was a hostage.
        
        A cloth across her lips stifled her cry for help, and a sedative's sweet aroma stung her nose when she inhaled, making her head spin.
        
        Were they going to kill her?
        
        Would the Black Swan really destroy their own creation?
        
        What was the point of Project Moonlark, then? What was the point of the Everblaze?
        
        The drug lulled her toward a dreamless oblivion, but she fought back - clinging to the one memory that could shine a tiny spot of light in the thick, inky haze. A pair of beautiful aquamarine eyes.
        
        Fitz's eyes. The first friend in her new life. Her first friend ever.
        
        Maybe if she hadn't noticed him that day in the museum, none of this would have happened.
        
        No. She knew it'd be too late even then. The white fires were already burning - curving toward her city and filling the sky with sticky, sweet smoke.
        
        The spark before the blaze.

      <h3>[Renegades]</h3>
      <p>
        Secret identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice. The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies — humans with extraordinary abilities — who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone…except the villains they once overthrew. Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice — and in Nova. But Nova’s allegiance is to a villain who has the power to end them both.
        Ever since the day her family was murdered, Nova has been unable to sleep. But she doesn’t miss it. In fact, her insomnia is part of her superpower: She never sleeps, and can put others to sleep just by touching them. After her family was taken from her, Nova was raised by the Anarchists, a group of villains who live hidden beneath the city, lying in wait to take down the Renegades and reclaim Gatlon for themselves. But now Nova is old enough to participate in the Renegade trials and potentially infiltrate their ranks. If she makes it through the trials, the Anarchists may come out of hiding.
