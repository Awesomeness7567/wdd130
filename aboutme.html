    <h2>Ava Johanson</h2>
    <p>I'm from Gilbert, Arizona and this is my first semester at BYU-I.<p>
    <p>I don't have a set major yet, but I am taking a lot of science and engineering classes.</p>
    <p>I love to play tennis and read, usually fantasy or sci-fi novels.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite general conference quotes is from the April 2022 session titled</p>
    <p>For God So Loved Us by Elder Ringwood and states, "No matter who you are or your current circumstances, someone feels exactly this way about you.</p>
    <p>Someone wants to return to Heavenly Father with you."</p>
